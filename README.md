# Purpose and Target Audience
I've build this website as a resume, a port folio of my previous, current and future work. Intended to showcase my work to potentional future employers in an enviroment I purposefully built to display it.  

# Functionality and Features
I wanted to build something that was mininalistic from a design stand point that would still have a strong impact. A home page is designed to draw the user in, to make an impact, to make the user click the next link. I hoped to achieve this with a large image, bold text, simple fade animation effects and an intentional lack of information. <br><br>
My home page is the first display of 3 of my components my Navigation bar, my Navigation drop down menu (Mobile only below 600px) and my footer. <br><br>
My about me page, follows suit massive high impact image, bold text and a matching annimation.<br><br>
My portfolio page is a showcase of my past, present and future, displaying my 4th component a section of grids to make up a fully animated functioning portfolio page, keeping with my minimalistic themes shows a set of images and headings (if desired) and upon clicking slides to the side to reval further details, this page was designed to me functional in the future I can relay my grids to have more or less sections, or even display multiple different grids for different areas of my work. <br><br>

## Portfolio
My portfolio page will display my body of work and it is quite easy to customise by expending the grid system to be bigger, or creating a series of seperated grids below. For now I have kept the one grid display some of my current Coder Academy work as well as my previous work as a Photographer.<br>

## Mobile home page
I ran into some issues with the menu display at mobile output (600px) where the font was crashing into the background image and it became hard to read, I decided to go for a drop down menu on the home screen so I coould continue to have an impactful home screen and a menu that functioned correctly and was visable to the user.

# Colour Pallet
Colour pallet was super important to keep a steady flow through the website, after selecting my home page image I wanted everything to be colourized with respect to it. The brown selection of my pallet is actually my hair colour from the background image. I knew I wanted a green and a red, staying with the pastel theme but still having some impact, I used a randomized pallet website to scroll through a bunch of different colours until I found some sets that I liked.
