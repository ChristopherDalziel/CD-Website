# Purpose
I've build this website as a resume, a port folio of my previous, current and future work. Intended for my future employeer to be able to easily access my body of work in an enviroment I purposefully built to display it. <br>
I wanted to build something that was mininalistic from a design and functionality stand point but still have a strong impact. I think the home (landing) screen has a big impact in your face right there that insites you to discover the rest of the web page. <br>
The other beneift of having such a minimalistic home screen is that it's really simple to build a completely different feeling website around it by changing out the personal image to a colour, patter or a different style of image will be a completely different feel. 

Purpose
This site was designed to show case my work to potential employers or clients looking to utilise my services and skills as a Fullstack Web Developer.

## Portfolio
My portfolio page will display my body of work and it is quite easy to customise by expending the grid system to be bigger, or creating a series of seperated grids below. For now I have kept the one grid display some of my current Coder Academy work as well as my previous work as a Photographer.<br>

## Mobile home page
I ran into some issues with the menu display at mobile output (600px) where the font was crashing into the background image and it became hard to read, I decided to go for a drop down menu on the home screen so I coould continue to have an impactful home screen and a menu that functioned correctly and was visable to the user.

# Colour Pallet
Colour pallet was super important to keep a steady flow through the website, after selecting my home page image I wanted everything to be colourized with respect to it. The brown selection of my pallet is actually my hair colour from the background image. I knew I wanted a green and a red, staying with the pastel theme but still having some impact, I used a randomized pallet website to scroll through a bunch of different colours until I found some sets that I liked.
