# Purpose
I've build this website as a resume, a port folio of my previous, current and future work. Intended for my future employeer to be able to easily access my body of work in an enviroment I purposefully built to display it. <br>
I wanted to build something that was mininalistic from a design and functionality stand point but still have a strong impact. I think the home (landing) screen has a big impact in your face right there that insites you to discover the rest of the web page. <br>
The other beneift of having such a minimalistic home screen is that it's really simple to build a completely different feeling website around it by changing out the personal image to a colour, patter or a different style of image will be a completely different feel. 
<br><br>
## Pages
Home - Basic landing page, links to my professional socials, impactful image, greeting and a navigation bar with internal links.
<br><br>
About - Keeping with the impactful theme I have continue to show the full size background image of myself with an speel about myself.
<br><br>
Portfolio - My portfolio page will display my body of work and it is quite easy to customise by expending the grid system to be bigger, or creating a series of seperated grids below. For now I have kept the one grid display some of my current Coder Academy work as well as my previous work as a Photographer.
<br><br>
Blog - Hardcoded blog page with all the information you'd need, images, poster, date, and lorem placeholder text.
<br><br>
Contact - A basic contact me page upon loading the page your instantly placed in the typing section of "Your name", optional phone number input, upon pressing submit it will send an email directly to my personal email.
